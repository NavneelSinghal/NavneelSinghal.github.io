## About

I'm currently a quant, and graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. My interests include machine learning, competitive programming, programming languages and geometry. I also like music and photography.

The Writings page contains some of my older writings I have written over time, along with some Math Olympiad resources.
