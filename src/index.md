## About

I'm currently a junior undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. My interests include machine learning, competitive programming, programming languages and geometry. I also like music and photography.

You can find me on [GitHub][] and [LinkedIn][].

The Writings page contains some of my writings I have written over time, along with some Math Olympiad resources.
