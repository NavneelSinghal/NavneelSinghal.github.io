# Website

This repository contains the source of my website, whcih is written in Markdown and CSS.

## Notes on usage of this template

There must be a comment on the second line of the Markdown file (in the `src` directory) indicating the page title (ideally enclosed as a comment). To generate the corresponding HTML files, just run `./build.sh` in the top directory. To customize this further, consider editing the CSS in `includes/css`.

Website design inspired from the [suckless philosophy's take on the web](https://suckless.org/sucks/web/).
